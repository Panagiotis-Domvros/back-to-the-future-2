                "Leonardo da Vinci": "To live on Mars, humans must master engineering, just as I designed flying machines before their time. Science and creativity will shape the first Martian city. But beware‚Äîwithout wisdom, technology alone is dangerous.",
                "Winston Churchill": "Mars is a new frontier, but it must be secured wisely. Humanity‚Äôs expansion must be governed by laws, democracy, and stability‚Äîor else it will repeat Earth‚Äôs mistakes.",
                "Marie Curie": "Mars presents extreme radiation challenges. We must first ensure human safety through scientific advancements before colonization."
            },
            "AI runs the world.": {
                "Karl Marx": "If AI controls the means of production, who owns it? If the people, it will bring equality. If the corporations, it will enslave us all.",
                "Nikola Tesla": "AI must serve humanity, not replace it. But beware, if programmed without ethics, it will not see the difference.",
                "Napoleon Bonaparte": "An AI leader must understand strategy. But without human ambition and adaptability, it will fail in true leadership."
            },
            "A new type of government replaces democracy.": {
                "Napoleon Bonaparte": "Governments rise and fall, but the strongest rulers shape the world. If democracy fails, the strongest must lead.",
                "Marie Curie": "Whatever system comes next must support science and knowledge. A government that silences discovery silences progress.",
                "Charles Darwin": "A government that evolves to meet the needs of its people will survive. Stagnation leads to downfall."
            },
            "People only use pictures and emojis instead of words.": {
                "William Shakespeare": "To banish words is to banish poetry, love, and passion. A world without words is a world without true expression!",
                "Charles Darwin": "Language evolves like species do. If people find images more effective, perhaps this is simply the next step in communication.",
                "Winston Churchill": "Words inspire. A world without words is a world without great speeches, without history, without leadership."
            },
            "People live in virtual reality instead of the real world.": {
                "Vladimir Lenin": "The ruling class will use virtual worlds to distract workers from reality. It is a new form of control‚Äîkeeping people from demanding real change.",
                "Marie Curie": "Living in a false world will make people forget real science, real progress, and real medicine. The virtual world cannot cure disease or explore the stars.",
                "Nikola Tesla": "Technology can create wonders, but it should not replace reality. A world of light without substance is just a shadow."
            },
            "The first war between Earth and a space colony.": {
                "Leonardo da Vinci": "A tragic but predictable event. War follows humans wherever they go, but perhaps in space, we can learn from history and avoid destruction.",
                "Karl Marx": "War is always about power. Will the new colony fight for freedom, or will it be controlled by corporate masters?",
                "Napoleon Bonaparte": "Colonies always seek freedom. If Earth wishes to rule space, it must do so with strength and strategy."
            },
            "Science discovers a way to extend human life indefinitely.": {
                "Charles Darwin": "Without natural death, evolution would halt. Humanity would stagnate, unable to adapt or improve.",
                "Nikola Tesla": "Science should always push the limits of the possible. But will endless life bring wisdom, or merely endless greed?",
                "Winston Churchill": "A man who lives forever must still find purpose. Without duty, without service, immortality is nothing but an empty eternity."
            },
            "Nations are replaced by mega-corporations.": {
                "Karl Marx": "This is capitalism‚Äôs final stage. If companies replace governments, the workers will be at their mercy, enslaved to corporate masters.",
                "Marie Curie": "Will science exist to serve humanity, or to serve the corporations? Knowledge must not be owned‚Äîit must be shared.",
                "Winston Churchill": "A nation‚Äôs duty is to its people. A corporation‚Äôs duty is to its shareholders. If the latter rule, who will protect the former?"
